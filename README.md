# The server component for cmdline-cast

The client component is avalable at https://github.com/fknipp/cmdline-cast.

This server uses [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) and is based on [Pup](https://cleverbeagle.com/pup).

## Status

This in work in progress. 

You can see my installation on https://cmdline.qnipp.com. I use it for my lectures in Linux at the [University for Applied Sciences FH Burgenland](http://www.fh-burgenland.at/). Burgenland is a federal state of Austria, the name would translate to castles country.
